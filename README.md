## Fresh installation for a speckle server deployment
Depending on your version, you should have in your server install location a `plugins` dir. If you don't, do update your server first and come back!

1. `cd ~/${your speckle server install location}/plugins`
2. `git clone https://github.com/speckleworks/SpeckleAdmin.git`
3. Restart your server, and navigate to its root address - TADA!
4. Profit!

If you have previously installed the SpeckleAdmin frontend plugin, you should be able to just
1. `git fetch`
2. `git pull`
